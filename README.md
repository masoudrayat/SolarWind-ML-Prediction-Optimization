# Optimization Sustainability: Machine Learning Insights for Enhanced Electricity Production from Solar and Wind Energy

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to optimize electricity production from solar and wind energy sources. The goal is to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of renewable energy generation by leveraging data-driven insights.

## Features

- Predictive models for solar and wind energy production.
- Optimization algorithms for maximizing electricity output.
- Data analysis and visualization tools for renewable energy trends.
- Comparative studies of different machine learning models.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Optimization-Sustainability.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Optimization-Sustainability
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Here is a brief example of how to use the project to predict electricity production:

```python
from models import SolarPredictionModel, WindPredictionModel

# Load your data
solar_data = load_data('solar_data.csv')
wind_data = load_data('wind_data.csv')

# Initialize models
solar_model = SolarPredictionModel()
wind_model = WindPredictionModel()

# Train models
solar_model.train(solar_data)
wind_model.train(wind_data)

# Predict electricity production
solar_output = solar_model.predict(new_solar_data)
wind_output = wind_model.predict(new_wind_data)
```
